01 = default from the web
02 = read in a file I made
03 = isolated particle dynamics (from the web)
04 = applying 03 to mine
05 = applying constraint to 04
06 = test for using znorg files
07 = test for using mio and znorg files
08 = importing the porphyrin nanoring
09 = constraining a molecule for x lower than some chosen x value
10 = constrain as in 09, include a spring constraint for distance R - Ro
11 = constrain including a rotation of second molecule in theta
12 = (should be 11) test rotation using atoms.rotate()
13 = copied 02, adding in constraints
